// Question:
// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
// By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
//
// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
//
// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
//
// Answer:

//Solution 1
//Create Variables
let previous = 0;
let current = 1;
let next = 0;
let sum = 0;
const limit = 4000000;

findSequence(limit);

function findSequence(limit){
  //limit the for loop too 100, it shouldn't need that many anyways
  for (var i = 1; i < 100; i++) {
    next = current + previous;
    previous = current;
    current = next;
    if (current % 2 == 0 && current < limit) {
      sum += current;
      console.log(sum);
    }
  }
}
